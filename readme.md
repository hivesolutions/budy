# [Budy](http://budy.hive.pt)

Simple e-commerce infra-structure, able to provide a simple experience equivalent to that
of platforms like [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com).

## Design

The main goal of the project is to provide a simple platform for e-commerce that does not
take care of all the transactional details like:

*  [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant transactions/operations
*  Financial secure transactions
*  Secure customer data

## Unit Testing

Test driven development should be a concern on the development of the Budy infra-structure
so that all the use cases are proper validated before implementation.
